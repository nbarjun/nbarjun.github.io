Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are important for moving moisture across the planet, but scientists don’t agree on a single way to define or detect them. This study compares different AR detection tools using climate model simulations of past climate conditions, including the early Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum. The tools mostly agree on how ARs shift with seasonal changes, but show much more disagreement when the overall climate is different—like during low CO₂ periods. This highlights that the choice of detection method can significantly affect results, especially when studying past or future climates.
