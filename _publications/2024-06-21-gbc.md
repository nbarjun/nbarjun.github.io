This study shows that climate change is likely to significantly alter the balance of carbon and phosphorus in dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ocean, especially in nutrient-poor regions. As ocean waters warm and become more stratified, less phosphorus reaches the surface, leading to changes in how phytoplankton grow and how carbon is stored and moved in the ocean. These changes could reduce the ocean’s ability to store carbon, weakening a key natural process that helps slow climate change. The study also finds that shifts in the carbon-to-phosphorus ratio of DOM may be an early and sensitive indicator of ocean warming.
