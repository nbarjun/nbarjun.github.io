This study uses a high-resolution climate model to better understand how the East Asian summer monsoon will change with global warming. The model does a good job of simulating current monsoon patterns and shows that as CO₂ levels rise, monsoon rainfall and extreme weather events are likely to become more intense. The increase in rainfall is caused by both changes in atmospheric circulation and the greater amount of moisture in a warmer atmosphere. Extreme temperatures also rise faster than average temperatures, and heavy rain events become more frequent, especially at very high CO₂ levels.
