Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) serve as crucial conduits for water vapor transport across midlatitudes, characterized by filament-like structures with intense precipitation, abundant cloud cover, and strong winds. This study aims to compare the responses of ARs to two distinct climate drivers: homogeneous greenhouse gas forcing and orbital cycles. To achieve this, we utilize ultra-high-resolution Community Earth System Model simulations to generate climate scenarios representing pre-industrial, double CO 2, Marine Isotope Stage 5d, and Marine Isotope Stage 5e periods. We specifically focus on regions exhibiting significant changes in ARs and subsequently investigate the linkages between these simulated changes, variations in water vapor content, and the behavior of major circulation systems, such as upper-level jets and extra-topical cyclones.
