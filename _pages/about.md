Hey there! Iâ€™m Dr. Arjun Babu Nellikkattil, a climate scientist and machine learning researcher passionate about unraveling the complexities of our planetâ€™s weather and climate. From predicting future rainfall patterns with AI to tracking extreme weather events using cutting-edge algorithms, my work bridges the gap between data science and real-world climate challenges.

Currently, Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Researcher at Georgetown Universityâ€™s Earth Commons Institute, where I develop open-source machine learning frameworks to improve long-term precipitation forecasts. My research blends global climate models, deep learning (Gaussian Process Regression, anyone? ðŸ˜ƒ), and high-performance computing to make sense of the chaotic climate system.

Before this, during my Ph.D. at the IBS Center for Climate Physics, I built algorithms to track extreme weather events and analyzed ultra-high-resolution simulations on some of the worldâ€™s fastest supercomputers. Iâ€™ve also worked on tools for extreme precipitation risk assessment and climate data visualizationâ€”some of my graphics have even made it to national TV!

Beyond research, I love collaborating across disciplines, contributing to open-source climate tools, and communicating complex climate science in a way that actually makes sense. If youâ€™re into AI-driven weather forecasting, extreme event detection, or just geeking out over climate data, youâ€™re in the right place.

Letâ€™s connect and explore the future of climate science together! ðŸš€
